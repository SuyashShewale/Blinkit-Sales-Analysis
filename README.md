# Blinkit Sales Analysis (SQL Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Blinkit's retail sales dataset using **SQL**. The analysis involves data cleaning, KPI tracking, and generating insights across various business dimensions such as item type, fat content, outlet type, and location.  

The goal is to demonstrate how SQL can be used to clean data, calculate performance metrics, and derive meaningful business insights from raw datasets.
